            Remote Attestation with Exported Authenticators
                    draft-fossati-seat-expat-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a method for two parties in a
   communication interaction to exchange Evidence and Attestation
   Results using exported authenticators, as defined in [RFC9261].
   Additionally, it introduces the cmw_attestation extension, which
   allows attestation credentials to be included directly in the
   Certificate message sent during the Exported Authenticator-based
   post-handshake authentication.  The approach supports both the
   passport and background check models from the RATS architecture while
   ensuring that attestation remains bound to the underlying
   communication channel.

1.  Introduction

   There is a growing need to demonstrate to a remote party that
   cryptographic keys are stored in a secure element, the device is in a
   known good state, secure boot has been enabled, and that low-level
   software and firmware have not been tampered with.  Remote
   attestation provides this capability.

   More technically, an Attester produces a signed collection of Claims
   that constitute Evidence about its running environment(s).  A Relying
   Party may consult an Attestation Result produced by a Verifier that
   has appraised the Evidence to make policy decisions regarding the
   trustworthiness of the Target Environment being assessed.  This is,
   in essence, what [RFC9334] defines.

   At the time of writing, several standard and proprietary remote
   attestation technologies are in use.  This specification aims to
   remain as technology-agnostic as possible concerning implemented
   remote attestation technologies.  To streamline attestation in TLS,
   this document introduces the cmw_attestation extension, which allows
   attestation credentials to be conveyed directly in the Certificate
   message during the Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake
   authentication.  This eliminates reliance on real-time certificate
   issuance from a Certificate Authority (CA), reducing handshake delays
   while ensuring Evidence remains bound to the TLS session.  The
   extension supports both the passport and background check models from
   the RATS architecture, enhancing flexibility for different deployment
   scenarios.

   This document builds upon three foundational specifications:

   *  RATS (Remote Attestation Procedures) Architecture [RFC9334]: It
      defines how remote attestation systems establish trust between
      parties by exchanging Evidence and Attestation Results.  These
      interactions can follow different models, such as the passport or
      the background check model, depending on the order of data flow in
      the system.

   *  TLS Exported Authenticators [RFC9261]: It offers bi-directional
      post-handshake authentication.  Once a TLS connection is
      established, both peers can send an authenticator request message
      at any point after the handshake.  This message from the server
      and the client uses the CertificateRequest and the
      ClientCertificateRequest messages, respectively.  The peer
      receiving the authenticator request message can respond with an
      Authenticator consisting of Certificate, CertificateVerify, and
      Finished messages.  These messages can then be validated by the
      other peer.

   *  RATS Conceptual Messages Wrapper (CMW) [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap]:
      CMW provides a structured encapsulation of Evidence and
      Attestation Result payloads, abstracting the underlying
      attestation technology.

   This specification introduces the cmw_attestation extension, enabling
   Evidence to be included directly in the Certificate message during
   the Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake authentication
   defined in [RFC9261].

2.  Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals as shown
   here.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the vocabulary and concepts
   defined in [RFC9334] and [RFC9261].

   "Remote attestation credentials", or "attestation credentials", is
   used to refer to both Evidence and attestation results, when no
   distinction needs to be made between them.

3.  cmw_attestation Extension to the Authenticator's Certificate message

   This document introduces a new extension, called cmw_attestation, to
   the Authenticator's Certificate message.  This extension allows
   Evidence or Attestation Results to be included in the extensions
   field of the end-entity certificate in the TLS Certificate message.

   As defined in Section 4.4.2 of [RFC8446], the TLS Certificate message
   consists of a certificate_list, which is a sequence of
   CertificateEntry structures.  Each CertificateEntry contains a
   certificate and a set of associated extensions.  The cmw_attestation
   extension MUST appear only in the first CertificateEntry of the
   Certificate message and applies exclusively to the end-entity
   certificate.  It MUST NOT be included in entries corresponding to
   intermediate or trust anchor certificates.  This design ensures that
   attestation information is tightly bound to the entity being
   authenticated.

   The cmw_attestation extension is only included in the Certificate
   message during Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake
   authentication.  This ensures that the attestation credentials are
   conveyed within the Certificate message, eliminating the need for
   modifications to the X.509 certificate structure.

   struct {
       opaque cmw_data<1..2^16-1>;
   } CMWAttestation;

   cmw_data: Encapsulates the attestation credentials in CMW format
   [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap].  The cmw_data field is encoded using CBOR
   or JSON.

   This approach eliminates the need for real-time certificate issuance
   from a Certificate Authority (CA) and minimizes handshake delays.
   Typically, CAs require several seconds to minutes to issue a
   certificate due to verification steps such as validating subject
   identity, signing the certificate, and distributing it.  These delays
   introduce latency into the TLS handshake, making real-time
   certificate generation impractical.  The cmw_attestation extension
   circumvents this issue by embedding attestation data within the
   Certificate message itself, removing reliance on external certificate
   issuance processes.

3.1.  Negotiation of the cmw_attestation Extension

   Negotiation of support cmw_attestation extension follows the model
   defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC9261].

   Endpoints that wish to receive attestation credentials using Exported
   Authenticators MUST indicate support by including an empty
   cmw_attestation extension in the CertificateRequest or
   ClientCertificateRequest message.  The presence of this empty
   extension indicates that the requester understands this specification
   and is willing to process an attestation credential in the peer's
   Certificate message.

   An endpoint that supports this extension and receives a request
   containing it MAY include the cmw_attestation extension in its
   Certificate message, populated with attestation data.  If the
   cmw_attestation extension appears in a Certificate message without it
   having been previously offered in the corresponding request, the
   receiver MUST abort the authenticator verification with an
   "unsupported_extension" alert.  As specified in Section 9.3 of
   [RFC8446], endpoints that do not recognize the cmw_attestation
   extension in a CertificateRequest or ClientCertificateRequest MUST
   ignore it and continue processing the message as if the extension
   were absent.

3.2.  Usage in Exported Authenticator-based Post-Handshake
      Authentication

   The cmw_attestation extension is designed to be used exclusively in
   Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake authentication as defined
   in [RFC9261].  It allows attestation credentials to be transmitted in
   the Authenticator's Certificate message only in response to an
   Authenticator Request.  This ensures that attestation credentials are
   provided on demand rather than being included in the initial TLS
   handshake.

   To maintain a cryptographic binding between the Evidence and the
   authentication request, the cmw_attestation extension MUST be
   associated with the certificate_request_context of the corresponding
   CertificateRequest or ClientCertificateRequest message (from the
   Server or Client, respectively).  This binding ensures that:

   *  The Evidence is specific to the authentication event and cannot be
      replayed across different TLS sessions.

   *  The Evidence remains tied to the cryptographic context of the TLS
      session.

3.3.  Cryptographic Binding of the Evidence to the TLS Session

   The attester MUST bind the attestation evidence to the active TLS
   session.  To do so, the attester derives a binding value using the
   TLS exporter and the exporter_master_secret of the current TLS
   connection.  The exporter invocation uses:

   *  the label "Attestation Binding", and

   *  the certificate_request_context from the CertificateRequest
      message as the exporter context.

   The attester MUST include the exporter value exactly as produced in
   the attestation evidence.

   To allow verification, the TLS endpoint that receives the attestation
   evidence MUST compute the exporter value using the same exporter
   invocation described for the attester.  The TLS endpoint can verify
   the exporter binding directly; if it does, it MUST reject the
   attestation evidence when the values do not match.  If the TLS
   endpoint does not perform this check itself, it MUST convey the
   computed exporter value to the Relying Party (RP) so that the RP can
   perform the comparison as part of attestation validation.

3.4.  Ensuring Compatibility with X.509 Certificate Validation

   The cmw_attestation extension does not modify or replace X.509
   certificate validation mechanisms.  It serves as an additional source
   of authentication data rather than altering the trust model of PKI-
   based authentication.  Specifically:

   *  Certificate validation (e.g., signature verification, revocation
      checks) MUST still be performed according to TLS [RFC8446] and
      PKIX [RFC5280].

   *  The attestation credentials carried in cmw_attestation MUST NOT be
      used as a substitute for X.509 certificate validation but can be
      used alongside standard certificate validation for additional
      security assurances.

   *  Implementations MAY reject connections where the certificate is
      valid but the attestation credentials is missing or does not meet
      security policy.

3.5.  Applicability to Client and Server Authentication

   The cmw_attestation extension is applicable to both client and server
   authentication in Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake
   authentication.

   In TLS, one party acts as the Relying Party, and the other party acts
   as the Attester.  Either the client or the server may fulfill these
   roles depending on the authentication direction.

   The Attester may respond with either:

   *  Evidence (Background Check Model):

      -  The Attester generates Evidence and includes it in the
         cmw_attestation extension to the Authenticator's Certificate
         message.

      -  The Relying Party forwards the Evidence to an external Verifier
         for evaluation and waits for an Attestation Result.

      -  The Relying Party grants or denies access, or continues or
         terminates the TLS session, based on the Verifier's Attestation
         Result.

   *  Attestation Result (Passport Model):

      -  The Attester sends Evidence to a Verifier beforehand.

      -  The Verifier issues an Attestation Result to the Attester.

      -  The Attester includes the Attestation Result in the
         cmw_attestation extension to the Authenticator's Certificate
         message and sends it to the Relying Party.

      -  The Relying Party validates the Attestation Result directly
         without needing to contact an external Verifier.

   By allowing both Evidence and Attestation Results to be conveyed
   within cmw_attestation, this mechanism supports flexible attestation
   workflows depending on the chosen trust model.

4.  Architecture

   The cmw_attestation extension enables attestation credentials to be
   included in the Certificate message during Exported Authenticator-
   based post-handshake authentication, ensuring that attestation
   remains bound to the TLS session.

   However, applications using this mechanism still need to negotiate
   the encoding format (e.g., JOSE or COSE) and specify how attestation
   credentials are processed.  This negotiation can be done via
   application-layer signaling or predefined profiles.  Future
   specifications may define mechanisms to streamline this negotiation.

   Upon receipt of a Certificate message containing the cmw_attestation
   extension, an endpoint MUST take the following steps to validate the
   attestation credentials:

   *  Background Check Model:

      -  Verify Integrity and Authenticity: The Evidence must be
         cryptographically verified against a known trust anchor,
         typically provided by the hardware manufacturer.

      -  Ensure Certificate Binding and Freshness: The Evidence must be
         explicitly associated with the certificate_request_context in
         the authenticator request to ensure relevance, freshness, and
         protection against replay.

      -  Evaluate Security Policy Compliance: The Evidence must be
         evaluated against the Relying Party's security policies to
         determine if the attesting device and the private key storage
         meet the required criteria.

   *  Passport Model:

      -  Verify the Attestation Result: The Relying Party MUST check
         that the Attestation Result is correctly signed by the issuing
         authority and that it meets the Relying Party’s security
         requirements.

   By integrating cmw_attestation directly into the Certificate message
   during Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake authentication,
   this approach reduces latency and complexity while maintaining strong
   security guarantees.

   In the following examples, the server possesses an identity
   certificate, while the client is not authenticated during the initial
   TLS exchange.

   Figure 1 shows the passport model while Figure 2 illustrates the
   background-check model.

4.1.  API Requirements for Attestation Support

   To enable attestation workflows, implementations of the Exported
   Authenticator API MUST support the following:

   1.  Authenticator Generation

       *  The API MUST support the inclusion of attestation credentials
          within the Certificate message provided as input.

   2.  Context Retrieval

       *  The certificate_request_context MUST be provided in all cases
          to ensure proper validation of Evidence.

       *  The receiving endpoint MUST use the "get context" API to
          retrieve the certificate_request_context associated with the
          exported authenticator as attestation-based authentication
          requires strict enforcement of the request context.  This
          ensures that the freshness of Evidence can be verified.

   3.  Authenticator Validation

       *  The API MUST verify that the Evidence within the Certificate
          message is cryptographically valid and bound to the
          certificate_request_context.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits the security considerations of [RFC9261] and
   [RFC9334].  The integrity of the exported authenticators must be
   guaranteed, and any failure in validating Evidence SHOULD be treated
   as a fatal error in the communication channel.  Additionally, in
   order to benefit from remote attestation, Evidence MUST be protected
   using dedicated attestation keys chaining back to a trust anchor.
   This trust anchor will typically be provided by the hardware
   manufacturer.

   This specification assumes that the Hardware Security Module (HSM) or
   Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is responsible for generating the
   key pair and producing either Evidence or attestation results, which
   is included in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  This attestation enables the CA to
   verify that the private key is securely stored and that the platform
   meets the required security standards before issuing a certificate.

5.1.  Security Guarantees

   Note that as a pure cryptographic protocol, attested TLS as-is only
   guarantees that the identity key used for TLS handshake is known by
   the confidential environment, such as confidential virtual machine.
   A number of additional guarantees must be provided by the platform
   and/or the TLS stack, and the overall security level depends on their
   existence and quality of assurance:

   *  The identity key used for TLS handshake is generated within the
      trustworthy environment, such as Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or
      TEE.

   *  The identity key used for TLS handshake is never exported or
      leaked outside the trustworthy environment.

   *  For confidential computing use cases, the TLS protocol is
      implemented within the confidential environment, and is
      implemented correctly, e.g., it does not leak any session key
      material.

   *  The TLS stack including the code that performs the post-handshake
      phase must be measured.

   *  There must be no other way to initiate generation of evidence
      except from signed code.

   These properties may be explicitly promised ("attested") by the
   platform, or they can be assured in other ways such as by providing
   source code, reproducible builds, formal verification etc.  The exact
   mechanisms are out of scope of this document.

5.2.  Using the TLS Connection

   Remote attestation in this document occurs within the context of a
   TLS handshake, and the TLS connection remains valid after this
   process.  Care must be taken when handling this TLS connection, as
   both the client and server must agree that remote attestation was
   successfully completed before exchanging data with the attested
   party.

   Session resumption presents special challenges since it happens at
   the TLS level, which is not aware of the application-level
   Authenticator.  The application (or the modified TLS library) must
   ensure that a resumed session has already completed remote
   attestation before the session can be used normally, and race
   conditions are possible.

5.3.  Evidence Freshness

   The Evidence carried in cmw_attestation does not require an
   additional freshness mechanism, such as a nonce [RA-TLS] or
   timestamp, since freshness is inherently provided by the
   certificate_request_context in the authenticator request.

   The evidence presented in this protocol is valid only at the time it
   is generated and presented.  To ensure that the attested peer remains
   in a secure state, remote attestation may be re-initiated
   periodically.  In the current protocol, this can be achieved by
   initiating a new Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake
   authentication exchange, which will generate a new
   certificate_request_context to maintain freshness.

6.  Privacy Considerations

6.1.  Client as Attester

   In this section, we are assuming that the Attester is a TLS client,
   representing an individual person.  We are concerned about the
   potential leakage of privacy-sensitive information about that person,
   such as the correlation of different connections initiated by them.

   In background-check model, the Verifier not only has access to
   detailed information about the Attester's TCB through Evidence, but
   it also knows the exact time and the party (i.e., the RP) with whom
   the secure channel establishment is attempted [RA-TLS].  The privacy
   implications are similar to OCSP [RFC6960].  While the RP may trust
   the Verifier not to disclose any information it receives, the same
   cannot be assumed for the Attester, which generally has no prior
   relationship with the Verifier.  Some ways to address this include:

   *  Attester-side redaction of privacy-sensitive evidence claims,

   *  Using selective disclosure (e.g., SD-JWT
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] with EAT [RFC9711]),

   *  Co-locating the Verifier role with the RP,

   *  Utilizing privacy-preserving attestation schemes (e.g., DAA
      [I-D.ietf-rats-daa]), or

   *  Utilizing Attesters manufactured with group identities (e.g.,
      Requirement 4.1 of [FIDO-REQS]).

   The last two also have the property of hiding the peer's identity
   from the RP.

   Note that the equivalent of OCSP "stapling" involves using a passport
   topology where the Verifier's involvement is unrelated to the TLS
   session.

6.2.  Server as Attester

   For the case of the TLS server as the Attester, the server can ask
   for client authentication and only send the Evidence after successful
   client authentication.  This limits the exposure of server's
   hardware-level Claims to be revealed only to authorized clients.

7.  IANA Considerations

   // Note to RFC Editor: in this section, please replace RFCthis with
   the RFC number assigned to this document and remove this note.

Post-handshake vs Intra-handshake Privacy

   From the view of the TLS server, post-handshake attestation offers
   better privacy than intra-handshake attestation when the server acts
   as the Attester.  In intra-handshake attestation, due to the inherent
   asymmetry of the TLS protocol, a malicious TLS client could
   potentially retrieve sensitive information from the Evidence without
   the client's trustworthiness first being established by the server.
   In post-handshake attestation, the server can ask for client
   authentication and only send the Evidence after successful client
   authentication.
