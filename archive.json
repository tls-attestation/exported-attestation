This reduces the problem to essentially 1 round-trip time (for sending Authenticator Request and getting Authenticator) plus time for generation of Evidence and appraisal of Evidence. \n\nThe next rounds of remote attestation can be done on need basis.

The integrity of the exported authenticators must be guaranteed, and any failure in validating Evidence SHOULD be treated as a fatal error in the communication channel. Additionally, in order to benefit from remote attestation, it is recommended that Evidence MUST be protected using dedicated attestation keys chaining back to a trust anchor. This trust anchor will typically be provided by the hardware manufacturer.\r\n```",
