This may be done using exporters as follows:\n\n- Server puts `certificate_request_context` in AuthenticatorRequest (ClientCertificateRequest) \n- Client forwards that as `rdata` in Evidence to the Verifier\n- Verifier puts `rdata` as part of the AR. (It might require changes in the Verifier to also reflect `rdata`)\n- Client sends Exported Authenticator with AR containing the `rdata`\n- Server can then check the AR which includes `certificate_request_context` ",

That triggers the peer to generate a fresh Exported Authenticator with updated attestation (or fail to do so), and the verifier can decide whether to continue the session or terminate it based on that result.\n> \n> It might be helpful to include a concrete EAT-style example in the EXPATdraft, illustrating how claims like nonce, iat, and exp can support verifier-side policy, for example, enforcing evidence freshness, session binding, or attestation expiry. Since these claims are optional in EAT but highly relevant in this context, showing how they apply in the TLS Exported Authenticator setting would make the draft more implementer-friendly. ",

      "body": "As discovered during prototyping, it seems the draft doesn't properly document how to achieve cryptographic binding between TLS connection and attestation evidence. See [this comment](https://github.com/tls-attestation/attestation-exported-authenticators/issues/8#issuecomment-3477875917) for source, though the contents are duplicated below.\n\nThe binding we need to achieve must rely on some sort of exported keying material that gets hash-linked into the evidence. The current draft, leveraging RFC9261, presumably describes a way to do this. We probably confused some of the details of 9261:\n\n* The Handshake Context as defined in [sec. 5.1 of RFC9261](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9261#name-authenticator-keys) is an exporter value meant to be used in CertificateVerify and in the Finished messages.\n* We seem to have considered [`certificate_request_context`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9261#section-4-6.2) to be that binder, but it is NOT intended to work that way. It's just a nonce or, in any case, not something the peer should be able to compute on its own (from [sec. 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9261#name-authenticator-request): \"The certificate_request_context SHOULD be chosen to be unpredictable to the peer (e.g., by randomly generating it)\").\n\nWe likely mashed them up and considered `certificate_request_context` as an avenue through which an exported value is carried to the attester ([sec. 3.2 of expat draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-fossati-seat-expat-00#name-usage-in-exported-authentic)). There are two options to rectify this:\n\n1. use `Handshake Context` for TLS <-> RA binding as well.\n2. define a new exporter value with its own context and label.\n\nOption (1) would be easier, but I'm not sure if that's good practice for a cryptographic value that's clearly scoped in the original doc.\n\n@jhoyla - do you have any an opinion regarding these two options?",

The integrity of the exported authenticators must be guaranteed, and any failure in validating Evidence SHOULD be treated as a fatal error in the communication channel. Additionally, in order to benefit from remote attestation, it is recommended that Evidence MUST be protected using dedicated attestation keys chaining back to a trust anchor. This trust anchor will typically be provided by the hardware manufacturer.\r\n```",

For example, is a confidential workload trustworthy given that the platform has been appraised as trustworthy? Isn't RA just an exercise in propagating trustworthiness from RoT upwards in a software stack? That's my point of view - the code that \"blessed\" the key is trustworthy, so why wouldn't the key be?",
